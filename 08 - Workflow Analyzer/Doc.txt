 Using the Workflow Analyzer, you can:

Edit, disable and enable rules from Studio.
Run validation or validation and analysis at file or project level.
Manage errors and warnings in the Error List panel.
Build custom rules using the UiPath.Activities.Api package.
Integrate workflow analysis with prebuilt and/or custom rules in CI/CD pipeline configurations.

You can access the Workflow Analyzer options by clicking the Analyze File drop-down menu from the Design ribbon tab

The Analyzer runs workflow validation (checks for compilation errors) first, and only after it passes, it analyzes (checks for breaches against the defined Workflow Analyzer rules) the workflow.
