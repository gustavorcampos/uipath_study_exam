The Computer Vision activities contain refactored fundamental UI Automation activities such as Click, Type Into, or Get Text. The main difference between the Computer Vision activities and their classic counterparts is their usage of the Computer Vision neural network developed in-house by our Machine Learning department. The neural network is able to identify UI elements such as buttons, text input fields, or check boxes without the use of selectors.

Created mainly for automation in virtual desktop environments, such as Citrix machines, these activities bypass the issue of non-existent or unreliable selectors, as they send images of the window you are automating to the neural network, where it is analyzed and all UI elements are identified and labeled according to what they are.

All the Computer Vision activities function only when inside a CV Screen Scope activity, which establishes the actual connection to the neural network server

Area selection can also be used to indicate only a portion of the UI of the application you want to automate. This is especially useful in situations where there are multiple text fields that have the same label and cannot be properly identified.

The Screen Refresh (hotkey: F5) button can be used at design time, in case something changes in the target app, enabling you to send a new picture to the Computer Vision server to be analyzed again.
